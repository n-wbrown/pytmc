General Usage
+++++++++++++
Pytmc's primary program can be invoked with the command ``pytmc``. This utility
takes the tmc file generated by a TwinCAT3 project and creates an epics DB
file. In order for pytmc to work properly, the TwinCAT project requires some
markup to describe the PVs that it will create through the IOC develoepd with
pytmc. 

A second tool, ``xmltranslate``, makes xml and tmc files human readable. It is
intended for debugging. 




Python Usage
++++++++++++
Once installed pytmc and its components can be imported into a python program
or shell like any normal python package. Consult the source code documentation
for specifics.
